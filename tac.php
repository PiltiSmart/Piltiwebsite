                    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>



                    <p>The following Terms and Conditions apply to all products and services provided by Pilti Group
                        (hereinafter referred to as Pilti)&nbsp;</p>



                    <p>By accepting a quote, you are considered to have accepted these terms and conditions in full.</p>



                    <p><strong>What do both parties agree to do?</strong></p>



                    <p>You agree that: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your
                        company or your organization. You agree to provide pilti with everything that Pilti needs to complete
                        the project including text, images and other information as and when pilti needs it, and in the
                        format that Pilti asks for. You’ll review pilti's work and provide feedback and approval in a timely
                        manner. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out in these terms and conditions.
                    </p>



                    <p>Pilti team provide the services in a professional and timely manner. Along the way team will endeavour to meet
                        all the deadlines set but team Pilti team can’t be responsible for a missed deadline if materials have been
                        supplied late or have not approved or signed off the work on-time at any stage. Pilti will maintain
                        the confidentiality of any information provided.</p>



                    <p><strong>Project Delivery Dates</strong></p>



                    <p>If there is a hard deadline for your project, you must communicate it clearly up front before the
                        project begins. It is always my intention to complete your project on time. Revisions and your
                        response times play a major role in the amount of time it takes to complete your project.
                        Therefore, the project completion date provided by Pilti is not a guarantee.</p>



                    <!-- <p><strong>Smart Services and Services ******(needs update)******* </strong></p>



                    <p>These Terms and Conditions allow for up to three sets of revisions unless agreed otherwise prior
                        to starting the project.&nbsp; Extra revisions are subject to additional charges at Pilti's
                        discretion. &nbsp;</p>



                    <p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply
                        photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can
                        suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a
                        separate estimate for that. If you need any advice on these formats I’m always happy to help.
                    </p>



                    <p>I’m not responsible for writing or editing any text copy unless specified in the original
                        estimate. If you’d like me to write new content or edit text for you, I can provide a separate
                        estimate for that.</p>



                    <p>If you want to add anything new or change your mind about something as the project progresses
                        that won’t be a problem. I’m happy to be flexible and will provide a seperate quote as required.
                    </p>



                    <p>If a choice of designs is presented and one is chosen for your project, only that solution is
                        deemed to be given by us as fulfilling the contract. All other designs remain the property of
                        Pilti, unless specifically agreed in writing.</p>



                    <p>Please note: Once you approve a design it is considered final. After this any changes requested
                        will be quoted and billed seperately. Be sure to proof read carefully before approving the final
                        design.</p> -->

                    <p>Should something happen for any reason whatsoever that causes you to cancel this project once it
                        has begun, you are completely free to do so. You will simply be billed for any work completed up
                        to the point of cancellation, and Pilti will send you invoice for any work completed up to that point.</p>



                    <p>In the unlikely event that some life altering event happens to cause pilti to cancel this project, pilti
                        will hand over any work completed up to the point of cancellation and refund you for any
                        payments made on incomplete work.</p>

                        print-ready or digital files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I’m not required to keep
                        a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns
                        them.</p>



                    <p>I’ll own the source files unless we agree otherwise.&nbsp;</p>

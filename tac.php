                    <p>The vast majority of design projects run smoothly, without any problems. However, from time to
                        time, something does come up, and these terms and conditions are designed to ensure that we are
                        both protected from any unexpected circumstances. It also lays out the basic groundwork for how
                        the project will progress, and what’s expected of us both. </p>



                    <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>



                    <p>The following Terms and Conditions apply to all products and services provided by Helen Murphy
                        Freelance Graphic Design (hereinafter referred to as Helen Murphy or ‘I’)&nbsp;</p>



                    <p>By accepting a quote, you are considered to have accepted these terms and conditions in full.</p>



                    <p><strong>What do both parties agree to do?</strong></p>



                    <p>You agree that: You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your
                        company or your organization. You agree to provide me with everything that I need to complete
                        the project including text, images and other information as and when I need it, and in the
                        format that I ask for. You’ll review my work and provide feedback and approval in a timely
                        manner. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out in these terms and conditions.
                    </p>



                    <p>I agree that: I have the experience and ability to perform the services you need from me and I
                        will carry them out in a professional and timely manner. Along the way I will endeavour to meet
                        all the deadlines set but I can’t be responsible for a missed deadline if materials have been
                        supplied late or have not approved or signed off my work on-time at any stage. I will maintain
                        the confidentiality of any information that you give me.</p>



                    <p><strong>Project Delivery Dates</strong></p>



                    <p>If there is a hard deadline for your project, you must communicate it clearly up front before the
                        project begins. It is always my intention to complete your project on time. Revisions and your
                        response times play a major role in the amount of time it takes to complete your project.
                        Therefore, the project completion date I give you is not a guarantee.</p>



                    <p><strong>Design Services</strong></p>



                    <p>These Terms and Conditions allow for up to three sets of revisions unless agreed otherwise prior
                        to starting the project.&nbsp; Extra revisions are subject to additional charges at my
                        discretion. &nbsp;</p>



                    <p>You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply
                        photographs in a high resolution digital format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can
                        suggest stock libraries. If you’d like me to search for photographs for you, I can provide a
                        separate estimate for that. If you need any advice on these formats I’m always happy to help.
                    </p>



                    <p>I’m not responsible for writing or editing any text copy unless specified in the original
                        estimate. If you’d like me to write new content or edit text for you, I can provide a separate
                        estimate for that.</p>



                    <p>If you want to add anything new or change your mind about something as the project progresses
                        that won’t be a problem. I’m happy to be flexible and will provide a seperate quote as required.
                    </p>



                    <p>If a choice of designs is presented and one is chosen for your project, only that solution is
                        deemed to be given by us as fulfilling the contract. All other designs remain the property of
                        Helen Murphy, unless specifically agreed in writing.</p>



                    <p>Please note: Once you approve a design it is considered final. After this any changes requested
                        will be quoted and billed seperately. Be sure to proof read carefully before approving the final
                        design.</p>



                    <p><strong>Errors and Omissions</strong></p>



                    <p>It is the Client’s responsibility to check proofs carefully for accuracy in all respects
                        including but not limited to prices, spelling, and dimensions. Helen Murphy is not liable for
                        errors or omissions. The Client’s written approval of an artwork proof, will be taken as
                        confirmation that the project is correct and complete.</p>



                    <p><strong>Project Cancellations</strong></p>



                    <p>Should something happen for any reason whatsoever that causes you to cancel this project once it
                        has begun, you are completely free to do so. You will simply be billed for any work completed up
                        to the point of cancellation, and I will send you any work completed up to that point.</p>



                    <p>In the unlikely event that some life altering event happens to cause me to cancel this project, I
                        will hand over any work completed up to the point of cancellation and refund you for any
                        payments made on incomplete work.</p>



                    <p><strong>Copyrights</strong></p>



                    <p>You guarantee that all elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork
                        you provide are either owned by your company, or that you have permission to use them.</p>



                    <p>Copyright is retained by Helen Murphy on all design work including words, pictures, ideas,
                        visuals and illustrations until all costs have been settled. When your final payment has
                        cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:</p>



                    <p>You’ll own the visual elements that I create for this project. I will give you the finished
                        print-ready or digital files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I’m not required to keep
                        a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns
                        them.</p>



                    <p>I’ll own the source files unless we agree otherwise.&nbsp;</p>



                    <p>I reserve the right, unless you specifically ask me not to, to display your project as part of my
                        portfolio and for use on social media. </p>



                    <p><strong>Payment</strong></p>



                    <p>Payment is due within 30 days of date of invoice. Payments should be made by bank transfer,
                        referencing the invoice number. Payments made by cheque must be previously agreed and may be
                        subject to an administration charge.</p>

                        place before cleared funds have been received.</p>



                    <p>Helen Murphy reserves the right to charge statutory interest of 8% plus the Bank of England base
                        rate under the late payment legislation on overdue balances.</p>



                    <p>Helen Murphy is responsible for the payment of all government taxes with respect to the services
                        she performs for the Client as a sole trader.</p>



                    <p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p>



                    <p>Helen Murphy will not be responsible for any damages your business may suffer. I can not

                        damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be
                        unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable
                        from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining
                        provisions.&nbsp;</p>
